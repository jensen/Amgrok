# Apple Xcode .git ignores, taken from this https://gist.github.com/adamgit/3786883

# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# Version 2.0
# For latest version, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2013 updates:
# - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)

# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
# saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
# ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"
